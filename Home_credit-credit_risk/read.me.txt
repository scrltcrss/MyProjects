Hello! I want to tell you a little about myself and my work.
I'm Daniil Bokhan, a student in the Data Science field, aged 19.
I strive to develop and learn in the AI/ML engineering direction.
This work is related to the "Home Credit - Credit Risk Model Stability" competition on Kaggle, which took place from February 5, 2024, to May 27, 2024.
The solution work is located in the notebook "[MAIN]Home_credit-credit_risk".
In the draft folder, there are 3 out of 10 drafts that have been saved.
They do not represent any value and have almost no similarity to the main solution.
I decided to share them for those interested.
Thank you and enjoy reading my work :)
